# Topic-Arrays in Data Structure

### Author: Neeraj Shankar - codewithneeraj@outlook.com
## Getting Started

## About this repository:
Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple 
items of the same type together.

This repository contains C/CPP programs demonstrating various types of operations performed on arrays like Insertion, Deletion, sorting algorithms, etc.

## Running The code 
  ### Prerequisite
    Make sure the gcc compiler is installed on the system

  ### How to run using cmd or terminal

    To compile the program(Linux) - g++ filename.cpp -o a
    To run the program(Linux) - ./a

## List of programs:
#### 1. UnderstandingTheArray - demonstrates, how the arrays can be created and traversed.
#### 2. ArrayInsertion - insert an element or item in already created array at a given index
#### 3. ArrayDeletion - deletes an element or item from already created array at a given index
#### 4. BubbleSortAlgorithm - Time Complexity - O(n^2), stable algorithm , not adaptive but can be made adaptive
#### 5. InsertionSortAlgorithm - Time Complexity- O(n2) in the worst case and O(n) in the best case, stable algorithm, adaptive and not recursive algorithm
#### 6. SelectionSortAlgorithm - Time Complexity- O(n2), not a stable algorithm, not a recursive algorithm and not an adaptive algorithm
#### 7. QuickSortAlgorithm - Time complexity- worst case- O(n2), when the array is already sorted, best case-O(nlogn), not stable algorithm, not adaptive, recursive algorithm 
#### 8. Least_Average_Subarray -finds the start and end index the subarray with least average
#### 9. ArrayRotation - shifting element(s) from one end to other by a given factor.
#### 10. SearchAnArray - finds an element in given array by linear and binary search
#### 11. Binary_Search_In_Sorted_Array - uses binary search in sorted- rotated array.
